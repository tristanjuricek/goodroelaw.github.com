The Law Offices of C.W. Goodroe is a boutique law firm specializing in representing victims of injuries caused by the carelessness or wrongdoing of others.  In this day and age it is an unfortunate reality that when you are injured due to the fault of another, your injuries and suffering will not be taken seriously unless you hire a lawyer.
        </p>
        <p>
Christopher Goodroe has built his personal injury and maritime practice on the principles of attention to detail, persistence, and personal service.  He has successfully litigated cases in both Federal and State Court, and has consistently achieved exceptional results at mediation.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe is AV Peer Review Rated by Martindale-Hubbell (Highest Ranking Possible) and has been selected as a Northern California Rising Star by Super Lawyers Magazine two years in a row.  Recently he has been selected as one of the TOP 100 TRIAL LAWYERS in Northern California.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe represents maritime clients with wide ranging injuries, including toxic exposures, fractures, falls, burns, and head traumas.  His knowledge of the Jones Act and general maritime law allows him to aggressively promote his client’s interests.  Based on Mr. Goodroe’s maritime knowledge and experience, he served as a panelist at the 2012 Pacific Admiralty Seminar where he addressed industry leaders regarding the recent changes in the maritime laws and how those laws affect merchant seamen.
        </p>
        <p>
In addition to his maritime practice, Mr. Goodroe also focuses on representing victims of automobile collisions, slip and falls, police brutality, as well as victims of sexual assaults.  Christopher Goodroe has over a decade of experience fighting insurance companies and he understands the games they play.  The unfortunate truth is, that in this day and age, you need a lawyer in order to be treated fairly by the insurance companies.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe understands how suffering an injury can place enormous stress on both the client and the client’s family, and he makes it a priority to always be available to answer any questions or concerns a client might have about a case or potential claim.  He is personally with each client at every step in the litigation process to ensure no stone goes unturned.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe is a graduate of the University of California at Santa Barbara (1997) and California Western School of Law (2002), and when he isn't vigorously representing his clients' needs, he finds time to volunteer for the Federal Pro Bono Project where he provides legal counsel.  Mr. Goodroe also serves as a Board Member for the UCSB Gaucho Lacrosse Alumni Association.

        <h3> Maritime Law </h3>
        <p>
Christopher Goodroe has been representing merchant seamen, fishermen, ferry operators and longshore workers for over a decade.   He has successfully litigated maritime cases in both federal and state court, and has consistently achieved exceptional results at mediation.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe represents maritime clients with wide ranging injuries, including toxic exposures, fractures, falls, burns, and head traumas.  Many times these injuries are career ending which adds to the stress the clients feels.
        </p>
        <p><blockquote>
“I don’t have to tell you the dangers associated with working on the water because you face them on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, it is also well known that while maritime employers talk big about safety, they often fail to protect their employees.  As with many industries, safety is sacrificed in the name of higher profits and quicker delivery speeds.  From oil leaking on decks to deferred maintenance, maritime employers fail to keep you safe.  Safety protocols are rarely updated and when employees raise safety concerns, they rarely are acted upon. And the worst part is that if you get injured your employer will attempt to blame you for your own injury” -CWG
        </blockquote></p>
        <p>
If you have suffered an injury while working at sea don’t be surprised when you employer attempts to sidestep and limit any blame for your injury.  Even clear cut cases are usually vigorously fought.
        </p>
        <p>
After a maritime injury, your employer will pay for your medical treatment (known as Cure) and provide you with a daily stipend (known as Maintenance), because they are forced to under the law.  However, be prepared that you will have to fight them for anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
You won’t be provided lost wages or compensation for disfigurement or pain and suffering without legal representation. We recognize how stressful suffering a maritime injury can be.  From finances to family, the pressures can be overwhelming at times.  Hiring a lawyer will alleviate some of those stresses.
        </p>
        <p>
When selecting a maritime lawyer it is important to hire someone who keeps up with the latest laws and changes in the maritime industry.  Many times those changes benefit the merchant seaman’s case.  Based on Mr. Goodroe’s maritime knowledge and experience, he served as a panelist at the 2012 Pacific Admiralty Seminar where he addressed industry leaders regarding the recent changes in the maritime laws and how those laws affect merchant seamen.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe’s experience has earned him the respect of the maritime community.  His peers voted him as a Rising Star who’s in the top 2.5% of his field as published by Super Lawyers Magazine in 2012 and 2013.  Maritindale-Hubble has awarded him an A/V Rating, identifying him with the highest ethical standards in the industry, and he has been selected as one of the TOP 100 TRIAL LAWYERS in Northern California.

        <h3> Personal Injury Law </h3>
        <p>
Christopher Goodroe has over a decade of experience fighting insurance companies and he understands the games they play.  He has been voted by his peers as a Rising Star who’s in the top 2.5% of his field as published by Super Lawyers Magazine in 2012 and 2013.  He is an A/V Rated lawyer by Maritindale-Hubbell and he has been selected as one of the TOP 100 TRIAL LAWYERS in Northern California.
        </p>
        <p>
Insurance companies answer only to their investors and increasing their bottom line means doing everything to prevent paying out on your claim.  From delay tactics, to more ethically questionable practices, you will not get treated fairly.
        </p>
        <p>
All too often clients come to us after attempting to handle their personal injury claim on their own.  We have come to learn that our clients are reasonable people and they believe they will be treated reasonably by the insurance company.  Unfortunately, by the time we meet with them, they often feel like they have been inured twice. First by the accident itself, and second by the way they’ve been treated by the insurance company.
        </p>
        <p>
After months of dealing with an insurance company’s tactics you may feel angry, frustrated, and often still in pain from your injuries.  Insurance companies know that their tactics cause you to give up or settle for pennies on the dollar, which is why it is better to hire a lawyer from the outset.
        </p>
        <p>
Hiring a lawyer also allows you to focus on healing from your injury and getting back on your feet.   We recognize how stressful suffering a personal injury can be.  From finances to family, the pressures can be overwhelming at times.  Hiring a lawyer will alleviate some of those stresses.

              First, if you are physically able to, make sure you take photographs of the scene.  Everyone has a camera with there cell phone these days and some even have video capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as possible, write down as much as you can about the accident itself, your injuries, and the losses you’ve suffered.  Losses include medical bills, and missed work.
              Make notes of conversations that you have with people involved in the accident or the injury claim.  If you had a conversation with the person who caused the injury be sure to write down what was said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preserve evidence of who caused the accident and what damage was done by collecting physical evidence and taking photographs.
              Locate people who witnessed the accident and who might be able to help you prove your case.  Make sure to obtain telephone numbers and/or email addresses.

              You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
