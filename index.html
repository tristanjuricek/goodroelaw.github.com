        <h3> Maritime Law </h3>
        <div class="expandable">
          <p>
  Christopher Goodroe has been representing merchant seamen, fishermen, ferry operators and longshore workers for over a decade.   He has successfully litigated maritime cases in both federal and state court, and has consistently achieved exceptional results at mediation.
          </p>
          <p>
  Mr. Goodroe represents maritime clients with wide ranging injuries, including toxic exposures, fractures, falls, burns, and head traumas.  Many times these injuries are career ending which adds to the stress the clients feels.
          </p>
          <p><blockquote>
  “I don’t have to tell you the dangers associated with working on the water because you face them on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, it is also well known that while maritime employers talk big about safety, they often fail to protect their employees.  As with many industries, safety is sacrificed in the name of higher profits and quicker delivery speeds.  From oil leaking on decks to deferred maintenance, maritime employers fail to keep you safe.  Safety protocols are rarely updated and when employees raise safety concerns, they rarely are acted upon. And the worst part is that if you get injured your employer will attempt to blame you for your own injury” -CWG
          </blockquote></p>
          <p>
  If you have suffered an injury while working at sea don’t be surprised when you employer attempts to sidestep and limit any blame for your injury.  Even clear cut cases are usually vigorously fought.
          </p>
          <p>
  After a maritime injury, your employer will pay for your medical treatment (known as Cure) and provide you with a daily stipend (known as Maintenance), because they are forced to under the law.  However, be prepared that you will have to fight them for anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
  You won’t be provided lost wages or compensation for disfigurement or pain and suffering without legal representation. We recognize how stressful suffering a maritime injury can be.  From finances to family, the pressures can be overwhelming at times.  Hiring a lawyer will alleviate some of those stresses.
          </p>
          <p>
  When selecting a maritime lawyer it is important to hire someone who keeps up with the latest laws and changes in the maritime industry.  Many times those changes benefit the merchant seaman’s case.  Based on Mr. Goodroe’s maritime knowledge and experience, he served as a panelist at the 2012 Pacific Admiralty Seminar where he addressed industry leaders regarding the recent changes in the maritime laws and how those laws affect merchant seamen.
          </p>
          <p>
  Mr. Goodroe’s experience has earned him the respect of the maritime community.  His peers voted him as a Rising Star who’s in the top 2.5% of his field as published by Super Lawyers Magazine in 2012 and 2013.  Maritindale-Hubble has awarded him an A/V Rating, identifying him with the highest ethical standards in the industry, and he has been selected as one of the TOP 100 TRIAL LAWYERS in Northern California.

  Christopher Goodroe has over a decade of experience fighting insurance companies and he understands the games they play.  He has been voted by his peers as a Rising Star who’s in the top 2.5% of his field as published by Super Lawyers Magazine in 2012 and 2013.

          <p>
  Insurance companies answer only to their investors and increasing their bottom line means doing everything to prevent paying out on your claim.  From delay tactics, to more ethically questionable practices, you will not get treated fairly.
          </p>
          <p>
  All too often clients come to us after attempting to handle their personal injury claim on their own.  We have come to learn that our clients are reasonable people and they believe they will be treated reasonably by the insurance company.  Unfortunately, by the time we meet with them, they often feel like they have been inured twice. First by the accident itself, and second by the way they’ve been treated by the insurance company.
          </p>
          <p>
  After months of dealing with an insurance company’s tactics you may feel angry, frustrated, and often still in pain from your injuries.  Insurance companies know that their tactics cause you to give up or settle for pennies on the dollar, which is why it is better to hire a lawyer from the outset.
          </p>
          <p>
  Hiring a lawyer also allows you to focus on healing from your injury and getting back on your feet.   We recognize how stressful suffering a personal injury can be.  From finances to family, the pressures can be overwhelming at times.  Hiring a lawyer will alleviate some of those stresses.

            <h4>What should I do immediately following an accident?</h4>
            <p>
              First, if you are physically able to, make sure you take photographs of the scene.  Everyone has a camera with there cell phone these days and some even have video capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as possible, write down as much as you can about the accident itself, your injuries, and the losses you’ve suffered.  Losses include medical bills, and missed work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make notes of conversations that you have with people involved in the accident or the injury claim.  If you had a conversation with the person who caused the injury be sure to write down what was said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preserve evidence of who caused the accident and what damage was done by collecting physical evidence and taking photographs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Locate people who witnessed the accident and who might be able to help you prove your case.  Make sure to obtain telephone numbers and/or email addresses.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="slide hidden">
            <h4>
              Do I have to provide a statement to the defendant’s insurance company?
            </h4>
            <p>
              NO! We advise all of our clients not to speak with the defendant’s insurance agent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Defendant’s insurance agent will likely to contact you shortly after the accident and ask that you provide a recorded statement (<em>if they haven’t already done so</em>).  Insurance adjusters are highly trained, skilled professionals whose job description is to reduce the amount of money their employer has to pay to settle or resolve bodily injury claims.
             </p>
             <p>
               Be forewarned, even the most straightforward liability accident may contain “hidden” legal nuances upon which your ability to receive compensation may depend on.  If you are unaware of these nuances, a simple recorded phone conversation (which may be used as evidence at trial) can significantly reduce your potential settlement award.
             </p>
             <p>
               We advise all of our clients not to speak with the defendant’s insurance agent.

            <h4>
              How much is my case worth?
            </h4>
            <p>
             Determining the worth of your personal injury claim will depend on several factors, including but not limited to the severity of your injuries, insurance limits, the details of the case, and how the defendant’s lawyer evaluates whether or now a jury will be sympathetic to you.  Assuming that there is liability in your case, there are five areas we as personal injury lawyers look to in attempting to evaluate your claim.  These areas include:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li> Past medical bills </li>
            <li> Future medical bills </li>
            <li> Lost wages </li>
            <li> Pain and suffering </li>
            <li> Loss of earning capacity </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There is no blueprint for determining a case's value; it is based on evidence, such as whether there are discrepancies in the testimony, medical records, or other pieces that may detract from the integrity of the injured party's case.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following factors will be considered when determining the amount of compensation owed for your injuries: the severity of your injuries; the details of your accident; your degree of fault; your employment history; your ability to work; and your life expectancy. The manner in which you obtain medical treatment, your lifestyle, and your litigation history will also be considered.

          <div class="slide hidden">
            <h4> How long will my personal injury lawsuit take?</h4>
            <p>
              It's difficult to determine how long it will take to resolve a personal injury lawsuit.  Each case is unique and therefore, no real general timetable can be established for personal injury claims. A personal injury lawsuit may settle in a few months without the need for a trial, while others can take years to complete.  A lot depends on whether your lawyer can settle the claim prior to filing a lawsuit.

            <h4> What is a Contingency Fee? </h4>
            <p>
            A contingent fee enables you to hire a lawyer without paying any money up front, and without paying an hourly fee for the lawyer’s work. Most lawyers charge $250 to $500 per hour for their services.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Law Offices of C.W. Goodroe gets paid only if you receive compensation for your claim either through a settlement or upon a successful jury award. We are paid a percentage of what we recover for you. Our fee is set at 33.3% (one-third) from day one all the way through jury verdict (should your case get that far).
            </p>
            <p>
              Most contingent fees are not set by law, but are negotiable.  Our contingent fees are set out in a contract with that explains how our fee is calculated and we are happy to discuss any questions you have regarding our Fee Contract at the time we meet.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also advance costs for handling your suit, including filing fees, obtaining medical records, retaining investigators and experts, court reporters, jury fees and other matters necessary to prosecute your claim.  In addition to our contingent fee, we are reimbursed for these expenses on completion of your case.  The costs of prosecuting the claim are taken off of the top of the gross settlement before we take our one-third fee.

        <h4> The Law Offices of C.W. Goodroe </h4>
        <p>
Christopher Goodroe has built his personal injury and maritime practice on the principles of attention to detail, persistence, and personal service.  He has successfully litigated cases in both Federal and State Court, and has consistently achieved exceptional results at mediation.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe is <strong>AV Peer Review Rated</strong> by Martindale-Hubbell (<em>Highest Ranking Possible</em>) and has been selected as a <strong>Northern California Rising Star</strong> by Super Lawyers Magazine two years in a row and has been selected as one of the <strong>TOP 100 TRIAL LAWYERS</strong> in Northern California.  Recently Mr. Goodroe was selected as one of the <strong>TOP FORTY UNDER FORTY</strong> trial lawyers in Northern California.
         </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe represents maritime clients with wide ranging injuries, including toxic exposures, fractures, falls, burns, and head traumas.  His knowledge of the Jones Act and general maritime law allows him to aggressively promote his client’s interests.  Based on Mr. Goodroe’s maritime knowledge and experience, he served as a panelist at the 2012 Pacific Admiralty Seminar where he addressed industry leaders regarding the recent changes in the maritime laws and how those laws affect merchant seamen.
        </p>
        <p>
In addition to his maritime practice, Mr. Goodroe also focuses on representing victims of automobile collisions, slip and falls, police brutality, as well as victims of sexual assaults.  Christopher has over a decade of experience fighting insurance companies and he understands the games they play.  The unfortunate truth is, that in this day and age, you need a lawyer in order to be treated fairly by the insurance companies.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe understands how suffering an injury can place enormous stress on both the client and the client’s family, and he makes it a priority to always be available to answer any questions or concerns a client might have about a case or potential claim.  He is personally with each client at every step in the litigation process to ensure no stone goes unturned.
        </p>
        <p>
Mr. Goodroe is a graduate of the University of California at Santa Barbara (1997) and California Western School of Law (2002), and when he isn't vigorously representing his clients' needs, he finds time to volunteer for the Federal Pro Bono Project where he provides legal counsel.  Mr. Goodroe also serves as a Board Member for the UCSB Gaucho Lacrosse Alumni Association.
